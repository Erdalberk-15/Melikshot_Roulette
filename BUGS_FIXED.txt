BUGS FIXED - Melikshot Roulette 2D
========================================

1. CRITICAL BUG - GameView Single Player Crash
   Location: GameView.kt line ~60
   Issue: Tried to access players[1] in single-player mode (only 1 player exists)
   Fix: Added check for GameMode.TWO_PLAYER before accessing player 2
   Impact: Game would crash when starting single-player mode

2. Unused Code - GameStateSnapshot
   Location: GameState.kt
   Issue: GameStateSnapshot data class was defined but never used (leftover from removed rewind feature)
   Fix: Removed unused GameStateSnapshot data class
   Impact: Cleaner code, no functional impact

3. Missing Console Logging
   Location: GameState.kt - loadChambers() and shoot()
   Issue: Console logging for rounds and bullets was missing
   Fix: Added detailed console output for:
      - Chamber contents when loaded
      - Round information (shooter, target, result)
      - Damage dealt and lives remaining
   Impact: Better debugging and game state visibility

4. Project Name Mismatch
   Location: settings.gradle.kts
   Issue: Project name was still "BuckshotRoulette" instead of "MelikshotRoulette"
   Fix: Changed rootProject.name to "MelikshotRoulette"
   Impact: Consistent naming across project

5. XML Syntax Error - launch4j-config.xml
   Location: launch4j-config.xml line 4
   Issue: Missing closing tag </jar>
   Fix: Added proper closing tag
   Impact: Launch4j would fail to parse config file
